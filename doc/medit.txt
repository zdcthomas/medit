This is a pluging for editing the contents of any writable vim
register. The most common usage is probably editing macros, but 
it's also possible to edit the clipboard before pasting.

Opening the macro viewing window with *<Leader>q{reg}*
Once in the window *q* saves the current line and closes the window
or you can use *<Esc>* to close the window without saving.
